                <li>3 Tbsp. Parsley</li>
                <li>1 tsp. Oregano</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp. Salt</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp. Black Pepper</li>
                <li>2 Garlic Cloves, Minced</li>
                <li>1/4 Cup Water</li>
                <li>1-1/2 lbs. ground meat mixture</li>
                <li>3/4 Cup Dried Bread Crumbs</li>
                <li>1/2 Cup Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
                <li>32 oz. Marinara Sauce</li>
                <li>1 lb. Spaghetti Noodles</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic and water; whisk well.</li>
                <li>Add the meat, breadcrumbs and Parmigiano Reggiano. Mix with your hands until just combined.</li>
                <li>Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized meatballs, and place on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 10 minutes, then remove the baking sheet from the oven and use a metal spatula or tongs to turn the meatballs.</li> 
                <li>Put the meatballs back in the oven and cook for another 10 minutes, until they are nicely browned and almost cooked through.</li>
                <li>Bring the marinara sauce to a simmer in a large skillet. Season to taste.</li>
                <li>Transfer the browned meatballs to the marinara sauce, leaving the fat behind.</li>
                <li>Cover loosely with a lid or foil and simmer for about 10 minutes, until the meatballs are cooked through. Keep warm until ready to toss with pasta.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente. Drain, then toss with the sauce and meatballs.</li>
                <li>Transfer the spaghetti and meatballs to serving bowls and top with fresh chopped basil and more grated cheese.</li>
